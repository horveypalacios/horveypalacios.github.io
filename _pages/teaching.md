Research and mentorship play a critical role in my teaching as students learn analytical and professional skills from both interpersonal relationships and through hands-on project experience. I have served as a teaching assistant for courses in Archaeology, Biological Anthropology, and Cultural  Anthropolgoy at UCF. In addition to this, I completed an intensive semester-long graduate training program to prepare future faculty within the   Karen L. Smith Faculty Center for Teaching and Learning. This program developed evidence-based methods for "effective and engaging teaching in higher education" as well as provided space to hone lecture and content delivery skills. While at the University of Miami, I also served as an undergraduate teaching assistant for two forensic anthropology classes dedicated to human osteology and forensic field methods. These courses have also exposed me to teaching in face-to-face and online formats.
