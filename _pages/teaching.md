Research and mentorship play a critical role in my teaching as students learn from both interpersonal relationhips and analytical skills
through hands-on experience. I have served as a teaching assistant for courses in Archaeology, Biological Anthropology, and Cultural 
Anthropolgoy at UCF. In addition to this, I completed an intensive graduate training program in Preparing Future Faculty within the  
Karen L. Smith Faculty Center for Teaching and Learning which developed evidence-based methods for "effective and engaging teaching 
in higher education".
