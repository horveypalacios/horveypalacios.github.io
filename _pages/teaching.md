Research and mentorship play a critical role in my teaching as students learn from both interpersonal relationhips and analytical skills through hands-on experience. I have served as a teaching assistant for courses in Archaeology, Biological Anthropology, and Cultural  Anthropolgoy at UCF. In addition to this, I completed an intensive semester-long graduate training program in Preparing Future Faculty within the   Karen L. Smith Faculty Center for Teaching and Learning which developed evidence-based methods for "effective and engaging teaching in higher education". While at the University of Miami I also served as an undergraduate teaching assistant for two forensic anthropology classes dedicated to human osteology and forensic field methods.
