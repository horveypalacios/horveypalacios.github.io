Teaching is an extension of my research and mentorship practicesâ€”both grounded in a commitment to collaboration, skill-building, and ethical inquiry. I have served as instructor of record for courses in human anatomy, biological anthropology, and molecular biology methods, including place-based STEM research, training, and education through the NIH-funded _[Youth Enjoy Science (YES) Oklahoma](https://yesok.oucreate.com/)_ and the _[OU Anatomy](https://cindygordon.org/)_ program. My teaching philosophy is shaped by experiences across classroom, laboratory, and community-based settings, where I prioritize student-centered learning, hands-on engagement, and cultural relevance. I have also served as a teaching assistant for a range of courses in archaeology, biological anthropology, and cultural anthropology at the University of Oklahoma, the University of Central Florida, and the University of Miami.

In addition to formal teaching roles, I have served as a mentor and project instructor through _[The Community Archaeologist (TCA)](https://www.ou.edu/okpan/TheCommunityArchaeologist)_, a digital magazine and public scholarship initiative I co-founded at _[The Oklahoma Public Archaeology Network (OKPAN)](https://www.ou.edu/okpan)_ that trains students and early-career scholars in collaborative writing,science and heritage communication, editing, and visual design. Through TCA, I integrate mentorship into real-world, community-facing writing to help students build skills in public engagement, science communication, and co-authorship.

My pedagogical approach is informed by formal training through the Graduate Teaching Certification at UCF, the Indigenous Pedagogy Institute at OU, and instructional design programs focused on inclusive, backward course development. These experiences have shaped my commitment to culturally responsive teaching and to creating equitable spaces where students gain analytical skills, disciplinary knowledge, and confidence as scholars and practitioners.
