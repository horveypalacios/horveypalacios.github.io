Teaching is an extension of my research and mentorship practicesâ€”both grounded in a commitment to collaboration, skill-building, and ethical inquiry. I have served as instructor of record for courses in human anatomy, biological anthropology, and molecular biology methods, including place-based STEM research, training, and education through the NIH-funded _[Youth Enjoy Science (YES) Oklahoma](https://yesok.oucreate.com/)_ and the _[OU Anatomy](https://cindygordon.org/)_program. My teaching philosophy is shaped by experiences across classroom, laboratory, and community-based settings, where I prioritize student-centered learning, hands-on engagement, and cultural relevance. I have also served as a teaching assistant for a range of courses in archaeology, biological anthropology, and cultural anthropology at the University of Oklahoma, the University of Central Florida, and the University of Miami.

My pedagogical approach is informed by formal training through multiple programs, including the Graduate Teaching Certification at UCF, the Indigenous Pedagogy Institute at OU, and a course redesign summer course focused on backward design and inclusive curriculum development. These experiences have helped me cultivate inclusive and evidence-based teaching practices that prepare students to think critically, work collaboratively, and engage responsibly with science and society.
