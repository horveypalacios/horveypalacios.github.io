Meet Me
======
My name is Horvey and I am a Miami native, Hispanic-American LatinX man currently attending OU (BOOMER SOONER!). So, what made me want to be an anthropologist? The short answer is, that humanity fascinates me. Anthropology is full of people who desire to examine the past, help make sense of the present, and explain who we are as humans. I Can’t imagine a better way to spend a career.

What is this site?
======
I am starting this site and my blog NewAnthropos to write about what excites (and worries) me about the intersections of anthropology, higher education, and our current world. I am committed to decolonizing academia and eliminating systemic inequities that continue to affect underrepresented minorities and our full-throated inclusion in STEM fields. All opinions and errors in this site are entirely my own— unless cited otherwise haha #academichumor

Bridging Anthropologies
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.

Research
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

Creating Dangerously
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. 

Current Projects

For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages.

At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff.

I am even more certain that to create dangerously is also to create fearlessly, boldly embracing the public and private terrors that would silence us.
