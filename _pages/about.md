I am even more certain that to create dangerously is also to create fearlessly, boldly embracing the public and private terrors that would silence us.

Meet Me
------
My name is Horvey and I am a Miami native, Hispanic-American LatinX man currently attending OU– BOOMER SOONER! I am a broadly trained anthropological bioarchaeologist and with a regional focus on the Americas both ancient and contemporary. I currently work at the [Laboratories of Molecular Anthropology and Microbiome Research (LMAMR)](https://lmamr.org) within the Department of Anthropology and [The Center for the Ethics of Indigenous Genomics Research (CEIGR)](https://www.ou.edu/cas/anthropology/ceigr) at the University of Oklahoma, while completing my Ph.D. in Molecular Anthropology. Additionally, I am pursuing graduate certificates in Applied Statistics and Digital Humanities in addition to my doctorate. Lastly, I am a team member of the _Proyecto de Interacción Política del Centro de Yucatán_ & _Proyecto Sacbe Yaxuná–Cobá_ where I conduct fieldwork and community engagement as it relates to our ongoing research projects.

I am originally trained in Anthropological Archaeology at the University of Miami where I specialized in Maya Archaeology. After my time in Miami I attended The University of Central Florida in Orlando where I received my M.A. and specialized in Maya Bioarchaeology. While at UCF I also participated in graduate teaching development at the Faculty Center for Teaching and Learning and trained in stable isotope methods at the Laboratory for Bioarchaeological Sciences (LBAS). I also have experience working with museums in Florida and Oklahoma on the repartriation of skeletal remains and fullfilling federal NAGPRA compliance. Lastly, I have worked with local Florida Cultural Resource Management archaeologists on both state and federal excavation projects.     

Research
------
My current research area focuses on the intersections of Maya history, ancient biomolecules, and inequality. I am also interested in how molecular approaches to anthropology can be interpolated with community-engaged research practices to co-create ethical and timely research projects. Through a deliberate multidisciplinary approach, my research explores how bio-eco-social inequalities affect individual health, migration, and identity in the past and present.

I am interested in improvements to dietary and health reconstructions through integrating ancient biomolecules, biogeochemical isotopes, osteological analyses, and qualitative methods. I analyze ancient biomolecules primarily through discovery metagenomics of calcified dental plaque, known as dental calculus. This substrate is composed of genetic material from different sources, including diet, novel pathogens, and microbial ecologies that a molecular anthropologist can analyze and authenticate to gain a molecular picture of an individual's diet and health. Methodologically, I am interested in improving ancient dietary DNA analysis and integrating proteomics and metabolomics into research on ancient diet and health. I am also interested in understanding how multidisciplinary approaches to reconstructions of antiquity can refine our understanding of ancient (and contemporary) narratives of stress. 

Additionally, I am interested in comparative osteobiographies and the development of molecular biographies to further refine our interpretations of identity and personhood in antiquity. Theoretically, I am interested in how bioarchaeology and mortuary archaeology relate to concepts of situated biologies, collective memory, personhood, identity, and inequality. My previous research has attempted to identify patterns of bioarchaeological and mortuary variation from the earliest individuals of the ancient Maya site of Holtun, Guatemala, to analyze personhood and identity. Additionally, I have studied how body partibility and collective memory play critical roles in how ancient and contemporary Maya individuals remembered their ancestral communities.  


What is this site?
------
I am starting this site and my blog NewAnthropos to write about what excites (and worries) me about the intersections of anthropology, higher education, and our current world. I am committed to decolonizing academia and eliminating systemic inequities that continue to affect underrepresented minorities and our full-throated inclusion in STEM fields. All opinions and errors in this site are entirely my own— unless cited otherwise haha #academichumor

Creating Dangerously
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff.
