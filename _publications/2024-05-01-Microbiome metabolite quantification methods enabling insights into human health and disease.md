**Abstract:**
 Many of the health-associated impacts of the microbiome are mediated by its chemical activity, producing and modifying small molecules (metabolites). Thus, microbiome metabolite quantification has a central role in efforts to elucidate and measure microbiome function. In this review, we cover general considerations when designing experiments to quantify microbiome metabolites, including sample preparation, data acquisition and data processing, since these are critical to downstream data quality. We then discuss data analysis and experimental steps to demonstrate that a given metabolite feature is of microbial origin. We further discuss techniques used to quantify common microbial metabolites, including short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), secondary bile acids (BAs), tryptophan derivatives, N-acyl amides and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO). Lastly, we conclude with challenges and future directions for the field.
