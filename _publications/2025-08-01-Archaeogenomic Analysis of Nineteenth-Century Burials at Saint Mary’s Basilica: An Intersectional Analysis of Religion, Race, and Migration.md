**Abstract:**
Objectives: The Basilica of Saint Mary’s of the Immaculate Conception in Norfolk, Virginia, is the only predominantly African American basilica in the United States. A community-based archaeogenomic investigation was carried out to investigate the history of its previous congregants.

Materials and Methods: Five burials were selected for excavation and archaeological analysis. The skeletal remains of these past Congregants were assessed to determine age, sex, and preservation status. Ancient DNA was extracted and sequenced at the University of Connecticut’s ancient DNA laboratory.

Results: Five burials excavated at the basilica yielded four sets of human remains of variable preservation and sex. Interment location, style and positioning of the burials suggested that they belong to the earlier Saint Patrick’s church (AD 1790s to 1856), adjacent to the current basilica. Osteological analyses indicated the presence of four adults and one infant. Ancient DNA results for three of the adults indicated that they shared ancestry with contemporary populations in Europe, specifically the United Kingdom, France and Spain. Interestingly, the autosomal and uniparental lineages of two adults showed connections to Spanish populations, with one displaying a unique L3f1b mitochondrial DNA haplotype tracing back to northern Spain.

Discussion: Using an intersectional theoretical framework grounded in historical research, we assess these findings to understand the lived experiences of these past Congregants in the context of religion, race and migration in early nineteenth-century Norfolk. Overall, this study highlights the value of an interdisciplinary archaeogenetic approach in exploring the intersectional lives of historic populations.
